# Battery Cycle Count

Program that displays the statistics of the charging cycles. These must be 
created in a <.csv> file.

The program is in the alpha stage. The documentation outside the source code 
has a very low priority at the moment. The documentation in the code describes 
the format of the <.csv> file and more. Since the code is not very large and 
complex so far, just look there.

It is also logical that the predictions are not very accurate, as no wear is 
included in the calculation. It is planned to implement these formulas from a 
PDF, but this may take a while.
